## 1. Introduction
This section introduces the fundamentals of radio astronomy and addresses the escalating impact of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) on observational data. It explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in mitigating RFI and outlines the primary challenges faced in this domain.

## 2. Background
Here, we delve into the basics of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) within radio astronomy, examining its common sources, radiation characteristics, effects on astronomical data, and the techniques used to differentiate genuine signals from noise.

## 3. Survey Methodology
Our survey on RFI mitigation in radio astronomy utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) employs a systematic methodology to ensure comprehensive and unbiased analysis. We sourced literature from prominent databases such as NASA's Astrophysics Data System and Google Scholar using targeted search queries to identify relevant studies. Strict inclusion criteria were applied, focusing on RFI mitigation via ML/AI, publications in English, and articles in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, while excluding unrelated topics and low-quality publications. From an initial pool of over 4,000 papers, duplicates were removed, and evaluations based on our criteria narrowed the selection to 40 significant studies. Data from these papers were extracted and organized into detailed tables, categorized by ML techniques, types of RFI addressed, and data sources used. This structured approach facilitated an effective analysis of current trends, methodological variations, and key findings, providing a robust foundation for advancing RFI mitigation strategies in radio astronomy.
