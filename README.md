## Project Overview

This project investigates the application of **machine learning (ML)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** for the detection and suppression of **radio frequency interference (RFI)** in radio astronomical observations.  It is an **ongoing project** of the **Center for Astronomy, Space Science and Astrophysics (CASSA)** ([https://cassa.site/entry/p2024002/](https://cassa.site/entry/p2024002/)), carried out in collaboration with the **Center for Computational and Data Sciences (CCDS)** ([https://ccds.ai/](https://ccds.ai/)) and the **School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia** ([https://fizik.usm.my/](https://fizik.usm.my/)).



RFI, predominantly arising from terrestrial communication systems and broadcasting services, poses a significant obstacle to data integrity in radio astronomy. While traditional mitigation approaches (e.g., filtering, shielding, and time-frequency analysis) have been employed, they are increasingly insufficient in addressing the complexity and scale of modern datasets.  

Recent advances in ML and AI demonstrate strong potential for **adaptive, scalable, and high-precision RFI mitigation**. Leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, these methods can significantly enhance data quality and reliability in radio astronomy.  

A **review paper** inspired by [Ndungâ€™u et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387647323000131) is currently in preparation for submission to *New Astronomy Reviews*. In parallel, we aim to benchmark widely adopted ML models on representative datasets and develop novel algorithms tailored to RFI mitigation.

## Motivation

Radio astronomy is uniquely vulnerable to interference from terrestrial and satellite-based transmissions. The rapid growth of satellite constellations and global communication infrastructure has intensified the challenge, leading to corrupted data and false detections.  

By integrating ML and AI approaches, this project seeks to establish **robust pipelines for automated RFI identification and mitigation**, advancing the field beyond the limitations of traditional techniques.

## Future Directions

- Development of specialized ML architectures for real-time RFI detection and suppression.  
- Expansion of **open-access datasets** to foster reproducibility and benchmarking.  
- Establishment of standardized **evaluation metrics and benchmarks** for cross-comparison of techniques.  
- Exploration of interdisciplinary collaborations with data science and signal processing communities.
