## Overview

This project investigates the application of **machine learning (ML)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** for the detection and suppression of **radio frequency interference (RFI)** in radio astronomical observations.

RFI, predominantly arising from terrestrial communication systems and broadcasting services, poses a significant obstacle to data integrity in radio astronomy. While traditional mitigation approaches (e.g., filtering, shielding, and time-frequency analysis) have been employed, they are increasingly insufficient in addressing the complexity and scale of modern datasets.

Recent advances in ML and AI demonstrate strong potential for **adaptive, scalable, and high-precision RFI mitigation**. Leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, these methods can significantly enhance data quality and reliability in radio astronomy.

## Motivation

Radio astronomy is uniquely vulnerable to interference from terrestrial and satellite-based transmissions. The rapid growth of satellite constellations and global communication infrastructure has intensified the challenge, leading to corrupted data and false detections.

### Key Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Satellite constellations | Increased interference density |
| Global communication expansion | More complex interference patterns |
| Data corruption | Loss of scientific observations |
| False detections | Misidentification of astronomical signals |

By integrating ML and AI approaches, this project seeks to establish **robust pipelines for automated RFI identification and mitigation**, advancing the field beyond the limitations of traditional techniques.
