## Research Overview

This investigation focuses on developing **machine learning (ML)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** methodologies for detecting and mitigating **radio frequency interference (RFI)** in radio astronomical data. RFI, predominantly originating from terrestrial sources including communication systems and broadcasting infrastructure, typically appears as strong narrowband signals, though broadband interference also occurs.

A comprehensive review paper, inspired by [Ndung'u et al. (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387647323000131), is being prepared for submission to *New Astronomy Reviews*. The study will include systematic benchmarking of established ML models on representative astronomical datasets.

Future work will involve the design and implementation of novel ML architectures specifically optimized for RFI detection and mitigation in radio astronomy applications.

## Research Context

Radio Frequency Interference presents significant challenges for modern radio astronomy by corrupting observational data. Conventional mitigation approaches often prove insufficient given the increasing complexity of interference patterns. This repository documents:

1. A systematic review of RFI mitigation strategies
2. Comparative analysis of traditional versus ML/AI approaches
3. Practical implementations of machine learning solutions

*This repository serves as both a knowledge base and demonstration platform for our ongoing research.*

## Research Significance

The proliferation of electronic devices has exacerbated RFI challenges in radio astronomy. Astronomical observations, which detect faint cosmic radio emissions, are particularly vulnerable to interference from both terrestrial and satellite-based sources. While traditional methods like spectral filtering and shielding provide partial solutions, they struggle with:

- Dynamic interference patterns
- High-dimensional data streams
- Real-time processing requirements

Machine learning approaches offer distinct advantages through:
- Adaptive learning capabilities
- Scalability to large datasets
- Improved detection accuracy in complex scenarios
