## Abstract

Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) significantly hampers radio astronomy by contaminating observational data. Traditional mitigation methods are often inadequate due to increasing data complexity. This repository presents a detailed review of RFI mitigation strategies in radio astronomy, focusing on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Through literature review, comparative analysis, and practical implementation, this work highlights how ML and AI can improve RFI mitigation processes.

## Introduction

Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is an unwanted signal that disrupts radio telescopes. As radio astronomy advances, increased electronic activity exacerbates the RFI problem, requiring sophisticated mitigation. This review explores the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assess RFI mitigation effectiveness.

## Background

### Radio Astronomy

Radio astronomy studies celestial objects through radio emissions, providing insights into pulsars, quasars, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Unfortunately, its sensitivity makes radio astronomy prone to RFI, compromising data integrity.

### RFI Overview

RFI originates from terrestrial (e.g., satellites, mobile phones) and extraterrestrial sources. It leads to data corruption and false detections, thus affecting the quality of scientific results.

## Literature Review

### Traditional Mitigation Techniques

Traditional RFI mitigation includes hardware solutions (shielding, filtering) and software methods (thresholding, time-frequency analysis). These approaches often struggle to adapt to an evolving RFI landscape.

### Machine Learning and AI Methods

Recent advancements in ML/AI—such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning—offer new approaches for identifying and mitigating RFI. These methods leverage large datasets and computational power for enhanced accuracy.

### Comparative Analysis

Traditional versus ML/AI-based methods are compared for effectiveness, scalability, and adaptability. ML/AI has notable advantages in handling complex, high-dimensional data.

## Survey Methodology

### Literature Search and Selection

- **NASA/ADS** and **Google Scholar** were used to search for papers related to RFI, ML, AI, and neural networks.
- **Initial results**: NASA/ADS yielded 81 papers, and Google Scholar provided 1,337 unique papers after filtering.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

- **Inclusion**: Focus on ML/AI for RFI, peer-reviewed, and published from 2014 to 2024.
- **Exclusion**: Irrelevant topics, low-quality publications, and duplicates.

### Data Extraction and Analysis

Extracted information such as study objectives, methodologies, and results was organized by ML techniques, RFI types, and telescope use.

## Methodologies

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves noise reduction, normalization, and segmentation, ensuring clean data for ML models.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering extracts characteristics from data to facilitate accurate RFI detection. Methods like time-frequency analysis are used to enhance model inputs.

### Model Training

Models such as SVM, Random Forests, CNNs, and RNNs are trained with optimized hyperparameters. Training procedures and validation techniques are explained.

### Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model performance.

## Results

### Performance Analysis

The analysis compares ML/AI-based methods to traditional ones, showing significant improvement in detection rates and reduced false positives.

### Case Studies

Real-world applications of ML/AI for RFI mitigation in radio astronomy projects are presented, showing their practical benefits.

## Discussion

Challenges like data scarcity, computational demands, and interpretability are discussed. Hybrid approaches that combine traditional and ML/AI techniques are also considered.

## Conclusion

The integration of ML and AI into RFI mitigation offers promising advances for radio astronomy. The improvements in RFI detection and suppression using these technologies show the potential for future exploration.

## Future Work

Further research aims at developing more robust ML models, real-time mitigation techniques, and interdisciplinary collaborations for effective RFI management.
